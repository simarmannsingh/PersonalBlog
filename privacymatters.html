          <p>The notion of staying safe and secure has always bothered homo-sapiens ever since they left their caves and started their journey towards becoming what we call today 'the modern humans'. As humans evolved, their modus operandi of attacking and defending evolved extensively. Today, humans have to learn tactics as they grow, to attack and defend on so many frontiers that they it often leaves many poeple perplexed.</p>
          <p>Back in 1990 when the internet started, everyone started to believe it is the safe heaven and it has openned door to boundless opportunites. However, soon enough they realized that it is Not a safe heaven and can surely not be trusted with if certains defence mechanism is not put in place. Today, in 2020, our technology has evolved so much that many defence mechanisms are automatically being deployed to protect us from online world. But there is so much more to being safe and secure that the more we know, the better we appreciate about these things.The issues like privacy, safety etc are used so often in context on online world yet only a handful of people know how to stay secure.</p>
          <p>We humans value our privacy. The blinds on the windows or doors on the bathrooms serve th same purpose. They demonstrate that we value our privacy inherently. But these days, terms like Internet Proxies, VPNs, cookie tracking make it so much more difficult for a noobie to understand all this that they often give up on understanding that trying hard to understand it. Actually, it seems as if we've developed <b>Stockholm Syndrome</b> with the cookie trackers. </p>
          <p>We Need to stay vigilant, and when I say it 'need to', I mean it. It is not a wish anymore, its not that we merely 'want to'. Because if not, then survival is at stake.</p>
          <p>The reason for maintaining a good Online Hygine is very simple. It turns out that human instincts are not impulsive or random at all, but can be accurately predicted with the help of large data-set. Not only that, the behaviour can also be manipulated. So humans are just another slightly over complex machines and their behaviour can be analyzed, recorded and replicated whenever wanted.</p>
          <p>“Mammals, in particulars respond poorly to serveilance. We consider it a threat. Because animals in the Wild are tracked by predators. Philosophers and Sociologists’ve warned survelance foster manipulation, conformity and submission.” </br><i><b>- Paul Carugati,</b>Information Security Professional</i> </p>
          <p>We can protect ourselves if we follow these steps in our daily lives.</p>
          <p>Steps For Protection</p>
          <ol>
              <li>Use disposable emails more often when asked to give emails to access some content or to try some application. They delete automatically. They can be used for Dating apps/intimatcy apps/to order stuff discreetly. Yahoo has recently started a tab to generate 500 disposable emails for the same purpose. Google should follow this soon.</li>
              <li>Use private browsing (incognito mode) more often. Specially when ordering any stuff. Stored Cookies are not used in incognito so, many times websites treat your request as a new user request.</li>
              <li>Try using extensions like “TrackMeNot”. Big giants basically tracks your search queries to anazlyse your behavior, to see what exactly you are interested in. You can use this extension and It sends random search queriesto mess up the algorithms of search engines trying to analyze you. So, they would never get exactly what you like</li>
              <li>Many websites have ad-click functionality and when a user clicks on the ads, a request is made to urls you do not even want to click or without your permission. Many companies place different types of ads on different types of websites. Again, a strategy to analyze ‘you’. Because for them, ‘you’ are the product. You can use an extension ‘AdNauseam’ which clicks randomly on ads without showing rendering the page. All that happens in the background which messes the algorithms of those companies.</li>
              <li>Use TOR. It is LEGAL in most countries (except for CHINA, NORTH KOREA and a few more where govt. chooses to track their citizen’s every move). The TOR itself is legal and so it the deepweb. Just some part of deep-web which is called Darkweb lies in grey area and the reason is pretty straight forward. Various illegal things/services are sold/purchased. Since those things/services are ILLEGAL, trading of those is illegal too. And hence only those websites are illegal which offer such products and services. It is actually considered to be a more SAFE option for journalists and those who believe people might be tracking their every move (even-online).</li>
              <li>Use <b>F12</b> more often. Most of the time people surf the web and come across different media like text/images containing hyperlink. In simple English, a hand pointer appears instead of normal cursor indicating that it is a web-link. People click links way too frankly. Most browser show the contained hyper-links (or simply links) somewhere in the lower bottom corners of the browser. Check the link before clicking on it. If there is no mention of what exactly the link would lead you to, then click F12 and inspect the URL of the link. What you can also do is search the domain using any search engine suffixed by word ‘scam’. For example, if there is a link to ‘http://abcde.com/first-tag/second-tag’ then search on google <i>‘abcde.com scam’</i> . Some result might pop up where someone has raised voice against this if it is a bad URL. Also another thing to check is if the URL itself is served over http or https. The ‘s’ in the https stands for secure which means everything is served encrypted to your browser leaving no chance for anyone to snoop. Most big companies offer content over https and http is considered vulnerable</li>
              <li>Check links in Emails. Yes, normally emails contain just text. However, these days, you receive more designer emails than simple text emails. Those designer emails are actually html templates which many companies send as newletters etc. In fact, there is a huge community on twitter for those html emails (also called transactional emails) enthusiasts. I also happen to have designed an HTML template which I have planned to send to people when they forget to click on the confirmation links for subscription (Yes, you need to click on the link received in your email as well to subscribe successfully). While most newsletters you receive are from genuine/authentic companies and suspicious emails are automatically scanned out by your email provider’s spam identifying algorithms. But in certain cases, the hackers (or lets say bad people) could send you an html ‘designer’ email personally which contains links that would redirect to malicious websites. So, trust your instincts and again most browsers show the links when you hover your cursor over the hyperlink text. Inspect the url before clicking on it. Your one small teeny-tiny click could jeopardize all your security measures instantly.</li>
              <li>Check the sender of email as well. Whenever you receive an email, a name is shown most often instead of the email address in your inbox. But on careful inspection, you can see the complete email address as well. Its not rocket science at all. Understand it like this, if you are walking on a road and some stranger comes to you and gives you a chocolate, what would be your instinct? Would you siply start eating the chocolate or would you first try to understand who Is the person giving you the chocolate, why is he giving? If the chocolate is  all properly wrapped or is it re-wrapped ? What does your mom tells you? “Never take anything from strangers”. Its not some BS, it actually very useful rule for life. Coming back to the email domain, inspect the part after the ‘@’ symbol. So, if you received an email from ‘someone@mailicious.com’, check whether ‘malicious.com’ is an authentic domain or is it a scamming domain. How exactly can you check it? I’ve just told you in the last point, search the domain name on google (or other search engine) followed by the word ‘scam’. So, in this fictious case, search on google ‘malicious.com scam’. Chances are, google will list pages where poeple’ve expressed concern over this domain and someone have responded as well.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>We've to try a holistic approach to educate ourself and our loved ones. One famous mis-conception is that “Cyber security is ONLY for IT people.” Cyber security is NOT ONLY for IT people. Its for everyone holding a piece of metal wrapped silicon chip in their hand.</p>
           <p><b>NOTE:</b> WATCHOUT WHERE YOU CLICK IN AN ONLINE WORLD. ITS NOT THAT SCARY BUT ITS NOT THAT INNOCENT EITHER.</p>
